    // Compound Types

    // A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type.
    // Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.

    // Array Type
    // Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type.
    // Arrays in Rust are different from arrays in some other languages because arrays in Rust have a fixed length, like tuples.
    // In Rust, the values going into an array are written as a comma-separated list inside square brackets
    // Rust will panic at runtime if you try to access an element using indexing that is outside the bounds of the array.
    // The length of an array is part of its type, so arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap.
    // By default, arrays in Rust are immutable.
    // Youâ€™re allowed to change the values of a variable bound to an array, but you canâ€™t change the types of the elements in the array.
    // If you want to create an array that can grow in size, look to the vector type next.
